# 🚀 Space Missions Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes historical space missions, exploring trends, success rates, and country-wise contributions to space exploration. The dataset was scraped from [nextspaceflight.com](https://nextspaceflight.com/launches/past/) and includes all space missions since the beginning of the Space Race in 1957!

## 📊 Key Features
✅ Data Cleaning & Processing using **Pandas & NumPy**  
✅ Interactive Visualizations with **Matplotlib, Seaborn & Plotly**  
✅ Exploration of **Mission Success Rates, Launch Trends & Country-wise Contributions**  
✅ Insights into the evolution of space exploration over decades  

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains key information about space missions, including:
- **Mission Name**
- **Launch Date**
- **Rocket Type**
- **Launch Site**
- **Country**
- **Mission Status** (Success/Failure)
- **Company/Agency**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Handling)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** (Visualization)
- **Google Colab** (Development Environment)

## 📈 Insights Discovered
- **SpaceX** has the highest launch success rates in recent years.
- Mission failures were more frequent in the early decades but have decreased significantly with advancements in technology.
- The **USA & Russia** have historically led space exploration, but private companies are now playing a major role.
